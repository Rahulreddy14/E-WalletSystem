## For tracking the progress of the development of the application

Let's review the backend to ensure everything is in place and functioning as expected. Here's a checklist of what we've implemented and what might be pending:

### Backend Checklist:
1. **Environment Setup:**
   - **`app.js`**: Entry point for the backend, connects to MongoDB, sets up middleware, and loads routes.
   - **.env** file: Configured for MongoDB connection and JWT secret.

   ✅ **Complete**

2. **Database Connection:**
   - **`config/db.js`**: MongoDB connection using Mongoose.

   ✅ **Complete**

3. **Models:**
   - **User Model (`models/userModel.js`)**: Defines schema for users, including name, email, password, and balance.
   - **Transaction Model (`models/transactionModel.js`)**: Defines schema for transactions, including sender, recipient, amount, and description.

   ✅ **Complete**

4. **Controllers:**
   - **User Controller (`controllers/userController.js`)**:
     - Register user, login user, and get user profile.
   - **Transaction Controller (`controllers/transactionController.js`)**:
     - Create transaction, get transaction history, send notifications via RabbitMQ.

   ✅ **Complete**

5. **Routes:**
   - **User Routes (`routes/userRoutes.js`)**:
     - POST `/` for user registration.
     - POST `/login` for user login.
     - GET `/profile` for retrieving authenticated user's profile.
   - **Transaction Routes (`routes/transactionRoutes.js`)**:
     - POST `/` for creating transactions.
     - GET `/` for retrieving the user's transaction history.

   ✅ **Complete**

6. **Middleware:**
   - **Auth Middleware (`middleware/authMiddleware.js`)**: Protect routes by verifying JWT tokens.

   ✅ **Complete**

7. **Services:**
   - **User Service (`services/userService.js`)**:
     - Handles business logic for user registration, login, and password validation.
   - **Transaction Service (`services/transactionService.js`)**:
     - Handles business logic for creating transactions and fetching transaction history.
   - **Notification Service (`services/notificationService.js`)**:
     - Publishes transaction notifications to RabbitMQ.

   ✅ **Complete**

8. **Utilities:**
   - **Token Generation (`utils/generateToken.js`)**: Generates JWT for user authentication.

   ✅ **Complete**

### Pending Items:
1. **RabbitMQ Consumer**: We have a service that publishes notifications to RabbitMQ, but we haven’t yet implemented a RabbitMQ **consumer** service to send email alerts. If you want to implement that now, we can add it.

   - This would be a separate service or microservice that consumes messages from the RabbitMQ queue (`transaction_notifications`) and triggers email alerts to users.

2. **Testing**: Once the code is complete, you should test all the API endpoints using **Postman** or a similar tool to ensure everything works as expected.

3. **Error Handling**: While we've added basic error handling, you may want to expand it later for more detailed logging or better response messages in production environments.

### Final Steps Before Frontend:
- If you're okay with implementing the **RabbitMQ consumer** later, or if you don't need it right now, then the backend is **complete**.
- If you'd like to add the **RabbitMQ consumer** now, I can guide you through that.

Let me know if you're ready to proceed to the frontend, or if you'd like to add anything else before moving forward!
